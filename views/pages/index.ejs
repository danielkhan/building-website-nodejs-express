        <p>
          The Roux Academy gets thousands of submissions every year for artists interesting in
          participating in the CAC exhibits, and selects approximately 200 distinct pieces of
          contemporary art for display in their collective exhibit. In addition, 12 individuals are
          honored as Featured Artists - each being granted his or her own exhibit hall to display
          entire collections or themed pieces.
        </p>
        <p>
          Each Featured Artist has an opportunity to speak at one of our meetups and share his or
          her vision, perspective, and techniques with attendees on a more personal level than at
          our large conference. It is truly an honor to be a CAC Featured Artist and many past
          students artists who were featured at CAC have gone on to brilliant careers in art.
